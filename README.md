A standard independent componenent analysis (ICA) method for multivariate time series data relies on the joint diagonalization of the lagged-covariance matrices of the whiten data. In this repository, we implement the efficient joint diagonalization algorithm proposed in [Jacobi angles for simultaneous diagonalization](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277295728_Jacobi_Angles_For_Simultaneous_Diagonalization), Cardoso and al. (1996) and apply it for time series ICA.
